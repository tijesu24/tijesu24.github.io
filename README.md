# Web Synth
 A web app simple synthesizer built based on Webmidi and webaudio APIs.  
It is adapted from this [article](https://medium.com/hackernoon/how-to-build-a-collaborative-midi-app-with-express-js-socket-io-273663b63201)  

All you need to do is to connect your midi keyboard to the device and it will automatically detect it.  
Then click the button and you have a working web synth
